Argumentation from the particular to the general. \n\nCritical questions \nQuestions belonging to a certain type of nondeductive argumentation to check the degree of plausibility of a conclusion.\n\nSound argumentation \nAn argumentation for which the corresponding critical questions can be answered positively and which therefore makes the conclusion plausible if the premises are true.\n\nArgumentation by analogy\nA type of non-deductive argumentation.

The judgment is supposed also to apply to the analogous situation.\n\nfallacy\nfalse analogy / an error or deficiency in an argument\n\nMeans-end argumentation \nA type of non-deductive argumentation.

In terms of active responsibility it can be interpreted as implying that persons should only be allocated responsibilities that they can live by\n\nEffectiveness requirement \nThe moral requirement that states that responsibility should be so distributed that the distribution has the best consequences, that is, is effective in preventing harm (and in achieving positive consequences).\n\nLiability Legal responsibility: \nbackward-looking responsibility according to the law.
